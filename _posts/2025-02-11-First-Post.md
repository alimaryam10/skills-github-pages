How to Set Up Your Experiment in Qualtrics

Initial Steps:	
Check if there is an appropriate folder for your experiment, create your project here. 
If there isn’t, create a new folder and an experiment within the folder.
Make sure files, folders, and experiments have easy-to-understand names that group together.
Qualtrics: Specify whether you are running a pilot or a full experiment in the title of your experiment. Ex: Biomedical Enhancement Pilot A, Bodily Integrity Full Experiment A
Labeling studies: (all pilots can be labeled as A, B, C etc) and main studies should have “Full Study” or “Full Experiment” in the title, including numerics to indicate if it’s the first run of the full study (e.g., “Full Experiment A”)
Make sure you request access to view our template study on Qualtrics, which you will need to fulfill the following steps of the guide

Create a Google Folder for your experiment under the Lab Google Folder
At the end of the experiment, deposit the PDFs and QSF files of the Qualtrics survey within the Google folders.
